# Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website repository! This website serves as a digital portfolio showcasing my skills, projects, and interests in the field of physics and beyond. It is designed to provide visitors with insights into my academic background, research experience, and personal interests, particularly in the realm of sports.

## About Me

I am **Dibyajyotee Ghosh**, a recent postgraduate in Physics with a strong interest in research and development. I completed my Master of Science (M. Sc) in Applied Physics from Calcutta University, where I specialized in Applied Fluid Mechanics. My thesis, titled "Quantum Entanglement and Its Potential Applications," allowed me to explore the fascinating world of quantum physics and its implications for future technologies. I also hold a Bachelor of Science (B. Sc) in Physics from Presidency College, where I developed a solid foundation in the principles of physics and mathematics.

Throughout my academic journey, I have cultivated a passion for understanding complex physical phenomena and applying theoretical concepts to real-world problems. My goal is to contribute to innovative projects that push the boundaries of scientific knowledge and technology. I am particularly interested in the fields of quantum computing, nanotechnology, and renewable energy.

## Projects

In the **Projects** section, I highlight some of the key projects I have worked on during my academic career:

1. **Nanotech Armour**: Developed a nanotech armor that can retract and expand at the user's will, making it lightweight and adaptable for various uses. This project aimed to create a bulletproof material that could significantly decrease fatality rates in dangerous situations.

2. **Underwater ROV**: Designed an underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) equipped with IoT devices and ultrasonic sensors. This ROV was intended to detect underwater detonators and submarine movements, providing timely warnings to military personnel. The project has been applied for a patent, and further details are available upon request.

## Research Experience

My research experience includes working as a Research Assistant in the Department of Physics at IACS from August 2025 to May 2028. During this time, I conducted research on quantum entanglement and its applications in quantum computing. I utilized advanced spectroscopic techniques and MATLAB for data analysis, contributing to the development of custom-built experimental setups. My findings were published in reputable journals, including Nature.
